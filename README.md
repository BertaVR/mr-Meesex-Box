# mr-Meesex-Box
## What is the programme?
This is my first javascript programming exercise for school.  
The aim of this practise is to recreate a Rick an Morty episode in which a clone of Mr Meeseeks was released from a box  every time a button was pressed in orther to fulfill a request (a desire) made by the person who had pressed the button. Further information and user stories can be found in [this repo made by my professor](https://github.com/dfleta/proxy-pattern-mrMeeseks-js). The box and the meeseeks will both be singleton. Even if several copies of Mr Meeseeks are created they are liniked to the same unique protomeeseeks (what Plato would call the idea of Meeseeks - this is how I like to understand it ðŸ˜‹). The main app was provided by my professor and based on it I just programmed the modules box and meeseeks.
## Technical learnings
- Use of closures (encapsulation)
- Prototype inheritance
- Use of 'this'
